This project is based on ReactJS library, its good for beginners to undertstand the basics of react as in this project I made IMDb-clone in which I used moviedb site api to fetch the 
popular/top-rated/upcoming movies to display the content in project UI.
Added basic css for designing.

Used react-dom, react-router-dom and bootstrap to make things work beautifully and user freindly.
